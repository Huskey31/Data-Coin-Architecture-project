Project: Extract Crypto currency coins and clean columns and transform then load to mini data warehouse (PostgreSQL).I Had this process automated. Next I Created code that will pull coins from mini data warehouse then create a scatter plot with updated data this process is also automated but through different script. there is a ten second delay between scripts acting as a buffer. The graph is then saved to separate folder that saves all previous graphs. This process needs to be successful for 12 hours and needs to run every hour first test was ran manually which was at 17:12pm
