# Automated Crypto ETL Platform
Built an end-to-end ETL pipeline that extracts cryptocurrency data from CoinGecko, cleans and transforms it, and loads it into PostgreSQL. A separate script queries the database to generate price and market cap visualizations. The pipeline is fully automated to run hourly with logging and error handling.
